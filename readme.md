GENERAL NOTES:
- To continue with this series about colour would require some closely defined questions.
- Start of a session should involve revisting the previous session (start by reading the log!) and writing down any learnings about it; possibly writing out concrete questions to explore. Should take about 15 minutes.
- Each session ends with writing down a description about the finished work. Takes about 15~20 minutes to get this right.
- Actual work seems to take about an hour. Any 'general' scaffolding should not be considered part of this time. 
- Should take a list of previously done visual web experiments and try to expand on this. 
- Decide: is both a README.md and description.json really necessary?
- A list of questions to research should be compiled, so a session can started by directly selecting one of those questions from the list.


TODO:

  General:
  ☐ Set up live reload setup
  ☐ Make a static site frontend indexing all works + descriptions
  ☐ Set up scss compiler
  ☐ Set up babel to transpile JS


  Future:
  ☐ Set up Docker environment template for works involving (complex) systems such as databases and software generally not expected to be available on host
