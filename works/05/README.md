WORKSHOP 05 - 10/03/2019

VIII. Why color deception? -- after-image, simultaneous contrast

For a better understanding of why colors read differently from what they (physically) really are, we show now the cause of most color illusions.

Learnings regarding previous session:
- The previous session was very much focussed on technical representation and less on exploring the outcome. The ways of interaction have been kept more simple and this directly appeared to be more intuitive. 

Notes after session:
- An exercise like this leaves room for iteration, perhaps this concept of after-image can be explored in the future. Working with a time interval provides a new method of interaction which can be an interesting modifier. 
- Although the idea of these sessions is to learn about a certain concept of how colors work together, the learning are not entirely clear even for myself. Maybe session should be revisited to clear up there initial intentions?
- As written in the previous after session notes: I am losing interest in these solid ground exercise. Perhaps the next workshop can be based on gradients.
