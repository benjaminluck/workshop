WORKSHOP 10 - 16/05/2019

Pulsing Colors

Solid color planes gradually shifting in hue over time. A study in how colors logically follow up compared to eachother. 

Learnings regarding previous session:
- The previous sessions showed me how limited our ability to differntiate beteween colors is. Compared to letters, solid colors are an extremely simple way to assign meaning to something. However, it's quite difficult to recall that assigned meaning, as colors are so alike when compared to the highly specified shapes and curves of letters. 
- This raises the questions: to how many different colors can we allocate meaning in a single scene? What other factors are at play in assigning meaning to color? 

Notes after session:
- I struggled in finding a good moment to continue with these WORKSHOP sessions. Perhaps I should spent some time investing in generating a list of possibile workshop scenario's, as having an outline of an idea seems to greatly motivate me in initiating a session. 
- As 10 sessions have passed with this one, I would like to take the opportunity to revisit an earlier session and improve on that for #11.
