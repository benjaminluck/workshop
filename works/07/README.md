WORKSHOP 07 - 24/03/2019

X: Factual mixtures - additive and subtractive

Elements are placed on a solid background, their colors being multiplied as they overlap.

Learnings regarding previous session:
- I wasn't quite pleased with the result of the previous session, it seemed too theoretical and non-intuitive. 

Notes after session:
- The result of blending elements in CSS is something quite unexpected. Making the elements draggable quickly turns the piece into something interactive and allows the user to create some sort of composition. 
- I would like to dive a bit deeper into this idea and iterate on it. There's a lot of interesting ways to position the elements creating new colors when overlapping. Perhaps focusing on mobile devices and using device orientation would be a nice start.
- Rotating elements, resizing elements, skewing elements, scrolling the hue of an element are all concept I would like to try to apply in the iteration.
- This work is the first that in a way (clearly) embodies the concepts of 'Conditional Design' -- the viewer is not only tweaking parameters but truly is able to create their own composition. Conditional Design as a concept quite speaks to me, and I would like to find out why this work reminds me of it. Perhaps because of the ability to position (multiple) elements?
