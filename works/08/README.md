WORKSHOP 08 - 03/04/2019

X-2; Factual mixtures - additive and subtractive

Revisting: Elements are placed on a solid background, their colors being multiplied as they overlap.

Possible iterations: 

- Rotating elements, 
- resizing elements, 
- skewing elements, 
- scrolling the hue of an element are all concept I would like to try to apply in the iteration.

Learnings regarding previous session:
- Layering elements works well in trying to create an interesting composition. 

Notes after session:
- I feel restricted by my inability to directly transform an idea to a living example. Perhaps this is due to my tendency of wanting to work out a solution for trivial problems from scratch. On two occasions during this sessions I eventually stumbled on code that was already written by somebody else, drastically speeding up the process. Perhaps I should start searching for relevant libraries / code examples earlier on for the next sessions.
- Again quite some time was spent on writing code for generic operations instead of spending time iterating over multiple possibilities. I should spend some time revisiting previous sessions and set up an easy to use 'helper' library for these operations in future sessions.
