WORKSHOP 06 - 17/03/2019

IX. Color mixture in paper -- illusion of transparence

"It is obvious that in working with color paper there is no way of mixing the colors mechanically, as paint and pigment permit, and as they invite one to do on a pallete or in a container. Though this may first appear as a handicap, it is actually a challenge to study color mixture in our imagination, that is, so to say, with closed eyes." 

Learnings regarding previous session:
- The previous session introduced the element of timing / intervals which give the work a sort of duration. This is an interesting given to play with. Perhaps make time a variable?  

Notes after session:
- This session took frustatingly long to complete. Not due to complex problems to be solved, but because of my inability to iterate quickly on previous works. As this series in colors progresses I should be able to move quickly on certain aspects such as handling intuitive interactivity, DOM element manipulation, modifiying color values. This wasn't the case however and I'm not sure why. Perhaps I just couldn't find my focus -- sometimes you shouldn't try to force that. 
- I should take some more time in building a more robust working setup, as I continue to struggle with mundane scripting tasks that shouldnt take so long. I also spent quite some time trying to apply these paper / paint related to the screen which, although definitely possible, continues to lose my interest. 
- Adding meaningful interactivity to these existing works does prove to be difficult. 
- Making these works responsive to different screen sizes gets particularly complex when the amount of elements and their differing orientation changes.
