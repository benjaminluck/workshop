WORKSHOP 02 - 17/02/2019

VI. 1 color appears as 2 -- looking like the reversed grounds
"What color relatedness makes 3 colors look like 2?" 
or
"Find that color which on 2 different grounds loses its identity."

TODO:
  - Recreating the plates from the book (2 solid colour rectangles, 2 Xs, 1 rectangle connecting those Xs)
  - Make the hue shift again, this time by scrolling


General notes:
- A list of questions to research should be compiled, so a session can started by directly selecting one of those questions from the list.

Learings about previous session:
-  The previous session seemed to lack a clear goal, it's an interactive aesthetic work but it does not seem to answer a question. Perhaps a question was not clearly formulated in the first place?
- Transition makes the interactie fuzzy: although gradually shifting the hue over a fixed transition time makes the aesthetic perhaps more appealing, the feeling of controlling the hue of the two shapes seems to not come alive as much.

- Viewing #1: shapes should be a lot bigger in portrait orientation. #todo 
- The initial question as posed by Albers should be written in the descriptio #todo
- Move notes about the general workshop proces to a separate (general) after a workshop. #todo
