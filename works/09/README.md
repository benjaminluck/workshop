WORKSHOP 09 - 24/04/2019

ColorType;

Drawing with letters. Every keyboard character a-z (first), and A-Z (uppercase, last) is mapped to a color analog calculated from a given random base color. A small experiment as a nice little detour from the Interaction of Color. 

Learnings regarding previous session:
- Since I revisisted an earlier sketch I was able to put all my focus into iterating on the existing ideas. This proved to be quite resourceful and I'm quite happy with the result. Dragging elements as an instrument of interactivity quickly brings more complexity to the scene which makes the experience more interesting. Combined with the rotation of the device as a second axis of manipulation, the scene turns into a composition making machine. Good fun. 

Notes after session:
- This session was inspired by an idea that I noted down while doing 'something else'. I tend to get these ideas that are related to these sessions when doing something else that deserves my attention. As I wrote the outlines for this idea prior to the start of the session, you could say that this session itself already iterates on the idea. A great way to work, but sadly these epiphanies don't come often. 
- I'm not very happy with the color variations that are mapped to the letters. There's not really a visual relation between the colour rectangles that's as strong as the relation and meaning behind the characters they are generated from. 
- Currently I'm listing all possible character values and assign color values based on the alphabetical order. This results in quite an arbitray mapping of colors to letters. How can things like meaning, and the shape of words/character be a factor in creating the color mapping?
- Would it perhaps make more sense to map color values based on the position of letters on a computer keyboard instead of alphbetical order? For example: making sure that the range of characters from A to L (or " for that matter) are logical gradations of eachother?
