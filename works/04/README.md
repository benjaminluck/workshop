WORKSHOP 04 - 01/03/2019

"Light divided by the red, green and blue." 

RGB EXPLORATIONS -- having three columns on screen, each having a solid background color. On each of these columns the hexadecimal representation of the background color is shown. In the middle of the screen a rectangle is shown with these three colors (shades of R,G,B) combined as one color. Mouse/Orientation events control the 'strength' of these three colors.

A sort of freeform intermission between IoC based works. 

Learnings regarding previous session:
  - Interaction seemed to take kind of the main role on #03 and seemed to make it a bit fuzzy. By using different states / modes of interaction the whole scene seems to revolve mostly around figuring out the seemingly random colors changes -- which wasn't necessarily the point. How can a more straight forward interaction mapping be made?

Notes after session:
  - It happend to be quite of a time consuming session, with most of the time being spent on finding out how RGB relates to hexadecimal codes and accessing multiple CSS variables. The outcome of the work seems very straightforward and understandable, however it doesn't seem to provoke any questions -- which is good in a way but quite boring in another way.
  - The next session should start by getting back to the Interaction of Color. Current studies have been about solid colors. Perhaps it's time to move on to something more dynamic such as gradients?
