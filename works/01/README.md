WORKSHOP 01 - 13/02/2019

Kicking off with a humble study in colour, loosely inspired by Josef Albers' book "Interaction of Color". The aim of these work is to experiment with interaction & aesthetics in my line of work: the web. All of the works are attempts at drawing out questions about certain visual themes and how interaction could be used to influence these themes. 

A couple of quick remarks in retrospect of this first session:

- To continue with this series about colour would require some closely defined questions.
- Start of a session should involve revisting the previous session (start by reading the log!) and writing down any learnings about it; possibly writing out concrete questions to explore. Should take about 10 minutes.
- Each session ends with writing down a description about the finished work. Takes about 15~20 minutes to get this right.
- Actual work seems to take about an hour. Any 'general' scaffolding should not be considered part of this time. 
- Should take a list of previously done visual web experiments and try to expand on this. 
- Decide: is both a README.md and description.json really necessary?
