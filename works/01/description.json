  "description": "Kicking off with a humble study in colour, loosely inspired by Josef Albers' book \"Interaction of Color\". The aim of these work is to experiment with interaction & aesthetics in my line of work: the web. All of the works are attempts at drawing out questions about certain visual themes and how interaction could be used to influence these themes. "
